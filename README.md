# IS211-Assignment8

Hi Professor,

I struggled a little bit on this one. I tried to also use the MVC pattern as well and couldn't find out how to uncouple the view from the model. I also struggled with the Proxy pattern for the timed game. I'm not exactly sure what it's supposed to do, as the information I found online made it seem like it should be hiding something. That said my code does run with the following examples:

    python pig.py --player1 "C" --player2 "H" --timed "Y"

I made timed a yes or no situation and then ask for the amount of game time if it is "Y".

Please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions for the code.

Thanks,

Tim
