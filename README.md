Things to go over

- Abstract Classes - why use them, and how
- Static Methods - how to use them and why
- Factory Method breakdown again

Go back and fix

- Winning Score should be a 100, lowered to 50 for testing
- Winner View might be messed up
- Human Player Turn() might need to return something else
- Not sure if we need the boolean check in check_winner() in Game class
- If change_player() works correctly change it to terinary statement
- play_game() might need to return something for view to work correctly

I think my player class is my controller
the game is the model
and the view is the view
